# 📡 ESR-TP2-2024

This project, developed as part of the **Networked Services Engineering (Engenharia de Serviços em Rede)** course for the 2024/2025 academic year in the **Master's in Informatics Engineering (Mestrado em Engenharia Informática)** at the **University of Minho**, focuses on creating a prototype for an **Over-The-Top (OTT) media delivery service**.

The solution utilizes a **distributed architecture** over a CDN (Content Distribution Network) overlay network, eschewing a central bootstrapper for autonomous node organization. Key to the system are two custom protocols: a **streaming protocol** based on **RTP over UDP** for low-latency video transmission and a **control protocol** based on **TCP** for reliable communication, node-to-node routing, and network state management. The prototype implements dynamic network features and rudimentary **fault tolerance** mechanisms to ensure efficient, low-latency, and resilient real-time video delivery.
